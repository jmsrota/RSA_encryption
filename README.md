# RSA_encyrption Project 

## Project Summary 

- This short project was to showcase how RSA encryption works, I read about it, watched a few youtube videos explaining the concepts, but I wanted to cement my understanding by
  implementing the basic functionality of the encryption.

### What I learned

- The biggest takeaways from this project were: assymetric encryption is, public and private keys, RSA algorithm. First I learned what assymetric encryption is, and the difference
  between assymetric and symetric encryption.
