# RSA_encyrption Project 

## Project Summary 

- This short project was to showcase how RSA encryption works, I read about it, watched a few youtube videos explaining the concepts, but I wanted to cement my understanding by
  implementing the basic functionality of the encryption.

### What I learned

- The biggest takeaways from this project were: what asymetric encryption is and how it works to secure data, public and private keys, and the RSA algorithm. First I learned what assymetric encryption is, and the difference between asymetric and symetric encryption. I learned how the RSA algorithm encrypts content and how a public and private key are created uniquely by the algorithm. Overall, this small implementation gave me a great deal of understanding why asymetric encryption is not used for big data, as it is very expensive to implement and requires a great deal of calculations.
